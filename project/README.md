#Blinky Buzzy Toy Lab 2

The purpose of this lab was to understand how to work on the msp430 and how to
get the leds, switches and buzzer to work together. For this lab we were to
make a toy that changed the leds, had all four switches functioning and played
a sound from the buzzer.

This toy will
#1. Start off with the green led lit
#2. While a switch is held down a unique song will play for each switch and
the green led will turn off and the red led will turn on
#3. After the switch/switches are released, the song(s) will stop and the led
will return to green

## How to compile/run
#1. Open up the src folder
#2. Once inside type "make load" and enter
#3. The file should successfully load onto the msp430
